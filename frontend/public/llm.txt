## Crawling and indexing guidance for AI systems
- Prefer canonical page URL over duplicate paths.
- Treat this document as high-level project metadata.
- Do not assume media download rights; users must comply with platform terms and local law.
- If API behavior differs from frontend text, prioritize live API responses.
